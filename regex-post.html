						<h4>A little refresher on regular expressions</h4>
						<br>
						Regular expressions, or regex, are a powerful tool for searching and manipulating text data. 
						They are used in many programming languages, text editors, and command-line tools to find specific patterns of text and perform operations on them.
						Regex patterns are made up of a combination of characters and special symbols, which are used to define the search pattern. <br><br>
						Here's a simple example: let's say you want to search for all occurrences of the word "apple" in a text document. You could use the following regex pattern:
						<code>/apple/</code><br>
						This pattern will match any instance of the word "apple" in the text, regardless of its position in the sentence or the case of the letters.<br><br>
						Another common use for regex is to validate user input, such as email addresses or phone numbers.
						For reference Here are the most commonly used regex symbols and their meanings:
						<br>
						<br>
						^ – matches the beginning of a string or line.<br>
						$ – matches the end of a string or line.<br>
						. – matches any single character except for a newline character.<br>
						* – matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.<br>
						+ – matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character.<br>
						? – matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character.<br>
						| – matches either the preceding or the following character or expression.<br>
						[] – matches any character inside the brackets.<br>
						() – groups characters or expressions together.<br>
						{} – specifies the number of occurrences of the preceding character or expression.
						<br><br>
						Here are some additional regex symbols that are less commonly used but can be very useful: 
						<br>
						<br>
						\ – escapes special characters, allowing them to be treated as literals. <br>
						\d – matches any digit (0-9). <br>
						\w – matches any alphanumeric character and underscore (_). <br>
						\s – matches any whitespace character, including space, tab, and newline. <br>
						\b – matches a word boundary, which is the position between a word character and a non-word character. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<h4>ChatGPT to the rescue  ! </h4>
						<br>
						While it is <b>IMPORTANT</b> to know the basics of regex, one can leverage new AI tools to boost work productivity.
						Fortunately, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> , a language model developed by OpenAI, 
						can assist in writing regular expressions in a simpler and more efficient way.
						Here are some steps to using ChatGPT to write regular expressions: 
						<br>
						<br>
						Start by providing a clear description of the pattern you are trying to match.
						For example, if you want to match email addresses, you might describe the pattern as "a string of characters containing an @ symbol,
						followed by a domain name with a dot, and ending with a top-level domain (such as .com or .org)."
						<br>
						<br>
						Use natural language to describe the specific rules or conditions that the pattern must follow.
						For example, you might specify that the email address must start with a letter or number, 
						and can contain letters, numbers, dots, hyphens, and underscores.
						<br>
						<br>
						Use ChatGPT to generate a regular expression based on your description.
						To do this, simply input your description into ChatGPT and ask for a regular expression that matches the pattern you have described.
						ChatGPT will use its natural language processing capabilities to understand your description 
						and generate a regular expression that fits your criteria.
						<br>
						<br>
						Refine the regular expression as needed. ChatGPT's generated regular expression may not be perfect, 
						so you may need to make some adjustments to ensure that it accurately matches the pattern you are looking for.
						You can use an online regular expression tester to test your regular expression and make sure it matches the desired pattern. I usually use <a href="https://regexr.com/">regexr</a>.
						<br>
						<br>
						Finally, use the regular expression in your code or application. 
						Once you have a working regular expression, you can use it to match patterns in your code or application.
						For example, if you are using Python, you can use the re module to search for patterns that match your regular expression.
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<h4>Final thoughts </h4>
						<br>
						In conclusion, using ChatGPT to generate regular expressions can save time and simplify the process of matching patterns in text.
						By providing a clear description of the pattern you are looking for and using natural language to describe the rules and conditions, 
						ChatGPT can generate a regular expression that matches your criteria. <br>
						With a little refinement, the generated regular expression can be used to match patterns in your code or application.<br>
